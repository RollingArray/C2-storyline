`C2` is a platform designed to nullify any biasness in terms of race, age, gender, disability and culture when treating a workforce and provide measurable matrix for a best fit person to grab a a new opportunities

`C2` has the power to generate meaningful credibility metric for each individual team member by analysing the feedbacks provided by the reviewers of the deliverables

## âœ¨ Typical Inequality Problem in Workplace

In a typical workplace, work done by a resource is normally evaluated based on feedback from supervisors or customers respectively. Feedback providers give feedback depending on their assessment of the deliverable against each criteria and it is very subjective

Feedback criteria and weightages can vary depending on the category of task / deliverable.

If the feedbacks are analysed, there could be various biasness found in the feedback provided by the same person in different instances. Hence, this can bring `In-Quality` in a `Diverse workforce`

## :mushroom: Various types of Bias

Study shows, there are various types of biasness encountered while judging resources while providing feedback for a certain deliverable . A biasness in judgement may happen as consciously or unconsciously

## :briefcase: Case Study

<img width="400" align="left" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/case-study.png?raw=true"/>

`Joe` is managing a finical project. He has a team of `4 members`

Over a period of `time`, `Joe` wants to do an `Equality analysis` of all his team members for a `new engagement`, where he is looking for a best resource from his new engagement

## :briefcase: Solution Approach
<img width="400" align="right" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/approach.png?raw=true"/>

:one: Design the data structure which can pull feedback related data from the day to day task deliverables in an project
:two: Design an Algorithm which can evaluate these feedbacks and create a tangible output in terms of a credibility score of an individual
:three: Use the credibility score as baseline to find a assignee for an up coming opportunity
