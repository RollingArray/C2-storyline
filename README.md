## ✨ Typical Inequality Problem in Workplace

In a typical workplace, work done by a resource is normally evaluated based on ***feedback*** from ***supervisors*** or ***customers*** respectively. Feedback providers give feedback depending on their assessment of the deliverable against each criteria and it is very ***subjective***

<img width="300" align="right" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/pain-point.png?raw=true" alt="demo"/>

Feedback criteria and weightages can vary depending on the category of task / deliverable.

If the feedbacks are analysed, there could be ***various bias*** found in the feedback provided by the same person in different instances. Hence, this can bring ***`In-Quality`*** in a ***`Diverse workforce`***

## :mushroom: Various types of Bias

Study shows, there are various types of bias encountered while judging resources while providing feedback for a certain deliverable . A bias in judgement may happen as consciously or unconsciously

## :briefcase: Case Study

<img width="400" align="left" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/case-study.png?raw=true"/>

`Joe` is managing a finical project. He has a team of `4 members`

Over a period of `time`, `Joe` wants to do an `Equality analysis` of all his team members for a `new engagement`, where he is looking for a best resource from his new engagement

## :briefcase: Solution Approach
<img width="400" align="right" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/approach.png?raw=true"/>

> * :one: Design the data structure which can pull feedback related data from the day to day task deliverables in an project
> * :two: Design an Algorithm which can evaluate these feedbacks and create a tangible output in terms of a credibility score of an individual
> * :three: Use the credibility score as baseline to find a assignee for an up coming opportunity

## :briefcase: Design Foundation
### :snowflake: Projects

> Each project consist of number of ***Goals***, ***Sprints***, ***Assignees*** & ***Reviewers***

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/projects.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Goal

> Each ***Goal*** is associated to certain ***Activities***

<img width="800" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/goal.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Activity

> Each ***Activity*** has associated certain properties and more specificity has number of ***reviewers*** to judge how well the assignee has achieved the ***results***

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/activity.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Measurement Criteria

> Each ***Activity Measurement Criteria*** has ***Characteristics*** & ***Performance Statistics***

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/measurement-criteria.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Measurement Criteria Characteristics

> ***Measurement Criteria*** can have 2 distinct Characteristics. ***Higher The Better Result*** or ***Lower The Better Result***

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/measurement-criteria-characteristics.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Reviewer

> ***Reviewers*** judge any deliverables for a certain ***duration*** over a defined set of ***Measurement Characteristics***  and provide verified results

<img width="700" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/reviewer.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Feedback classification & Calculating Performance %

> Each ***Feedback*** gets classified based on pre-defined ***Activity Completion Indicator*** and ***Performance in %*** gets calculated

<img width="700" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/feedback-classification.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Calculating Weighted Performances %

> For a certain ***Assignee*** in a given duration, the activities are having different ***weights***, and total weight for that duration should not cross ***100%***

<img width="500" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/weighted-performance.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Calculating Activity Performance

> Based on number of ***Weighted Performances***, an ***Activity Performance*** gets calculated by taking ***Mathematical Mean*** of all performances

<img width="700" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/activity-performance.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Calculating Credibility

> Upon calculating activity performance for all the tasks assigned to an assignee, ***Credibility*** of the assignee can be derived in % or out of 5 by taking the ***Summation*** of Activity Performances divided by ***Activity Weight***.

<img width="800" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/credibility.png?raw=true"/>

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### :snowflake: Define Equal Opportunities

> Upon finding resources for a given ***New opportunity***, ***[`C2`](http://c2.rollingarray.co.in/)*** lists resources with ***Credibility Score***, hence the opportunity may gets assigned to the ***Top Scorer***. This nullifies any ***Bias*** in decision making and brings equality in diverse work force

<img width="700" src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/opportunity.png?raw=true"/>

> * Tap on + icon to create a new Goal
> * Tap on more option on each Goal to edit the Goal details

### :snowflake: Project Activities

<img align="right" width=300 src="https://github.com/RollingArray/C2-storyline/blob/main/images/project-activities.png?raw=true"/>

> * From left menu, you can navigate to Project Activities
> 
> * Choose Sprint, Assignee & Goal to see all the activities
> * Tap on + icon to create a new Activity by providing measurement criteria.
> * Measurement criteria is an important aspect of C2 . Hence the system enforces a lot of fair policies to consider while review
